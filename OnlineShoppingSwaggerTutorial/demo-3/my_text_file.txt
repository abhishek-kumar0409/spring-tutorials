Project Deliverables
Implemented an asynchronous solution to optimize the performance time for the package upload and extraction (by developing an approx. 500 LOC).
Implemented a solution to optimize the package extraction using OS utilities instead of programmatic approach (by developing an approx. 500 LOC).
Implemented Package versioning for single file upload and complete package functionality (by developing an approx. 100 LOC).
Implemented a solution to mandate the images directory in the CSAR package
Worked on design and implementation for Notification management system
Improve Customer Experience
The quarter initiated with my benefaction to VNF marketplace project stressing upon the users experience for the VNF and package management system.
The two important contributions are as followed:
“Package upload struck at 99%”:
Implemented a solution to resolve a high priority production issue by optimizing the execution and performance time to complete package upload and extraction operation. The users were able to perform activity during this phase. Earlier, the users were restricted to perform any user activity until the package extraction is completed.
“Make images as mandatory for CSAR packages”
I also implemented a solution to provide support to upload images as a mandatory artefact for the CSAR package for both of the complete package and individual file upload functionalities.
Didn’t hesitate to stretch beyond the working hours to work with onshore partners and collaborated with them to resolve the challenges faced in UAT and production issue.
